					<h2>How is Kwort built?</h2>
					<p>Kwort is a Linux distribution based on CRUX; we make use of their port system to build a set of minimal packages. While Kwort use binary packages, we offer the users this port system as well. Looking for the best tools aligned to Kwort's phylosophy is an on-going task during the whole year.
					<br>Because of all this, Kwort is extremely simple and straight forward Linux system.</p>
