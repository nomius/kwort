## Kwort 4.3.5 release candidate 1 out

First release candidate of Kwort 4.3.5 with lots of new stuff in it. Improvements, bug fixes, new software, clean as always. Give it a try!
If everything goes OK, we might see the final release really soon as I addressed everything I could have seen.

Unless any bug is reported, the only change I see happening on the next release candidate or final release is upgrading to 5.4.74 as this release went out with 5.4.73.

Detailed release notes will be put on here once the final release is out.
