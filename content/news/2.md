## Kwort 4.3.5 is in the wild

I'm very proud to announce this new release which shows how the project got to a very mature level. New goodies included in the UI, a few bug fixes from the previous release and of course, the latest stable packages.

Let's talk a little of what we have here:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Linux kernel 5.4.77.
* New toolchain including: glibc 2.32, gcc 10.2.0 and binutils 2.35.1.
* kpkg 130. Mirror kdb files are now included in the installation to avoid issues from the past.
* Latest browsers including: Google Chrome: 86.0.4240.198 and Mozilla Firefox 82.0.3. Newest version of brave is available in the mirrors.
* kwort-tools now includes encryption support through /etc/rc.d/encryption using /etc/etab (format is <directory> <key file>) and we have added a few improvements on kwort-mixer to add more stability.
* llvm 11.0.0 is also included.
=======
Unless any bug is reported, the only change I see happening on the next release candidate or final release is upgrading kernel to 5.4.74 as this release went out with 5.4.73.
