## Kwort 4.5 release

After three years, a new release is out. Kwort keeps being a clean, minimalist and polished system for daily usage for advanced users.

**What's new?

* Linux kernel 6.12.34. The latest vanilla long term support release.
* Updated toolchain including: glibc 2.40, gcc 14.3.0 and binutils 2.43.
* Latest browsers including: Google Chrome: 137 and Mozilla Firefox 139.
* kwort-tools includes some bug-fixes in xdg-open and browser selection. And we have also cleaned up entirely /usr/etc.
* llvm 20.1.7 & mesa 25.1.4 are also part of the default installation.
* Improved libva and vdpau stacks with compatibility for Intel (R), Nouveau and AMD (R) GPU drivers (Nvidia (R) propietary drivers are available in ports). See the [FAQ](documentation.html?faq) for more details.
* mplayer (with gmplayer enabled) and gnome-mplayer are back as default media players.
* Encryption guidelines are now clear in the Documentation section.
* While IRC is still being there (#Kwort @ OFTC). I'm more available through Telegram these days so I've created a [Kwort Telegram channel](https://t.me/+Pg3Rz9XdA643OWQx).

**Thanks to the people who always help us:**

* Ricardo Brisighelli for the package mirror at UNR.
* Andreas Schipplock who is our domain sponsor and who set up our main ISO mirror. Andreas also fixed the mirror last year when it went down for a few days.
* The CRUX folks for developing it, as it's Kwort's base.
* And of course, the people who develop every project Kwort makes use of. THANK YOU!
